# DofusLike

This project made with Unity 2018.3, NodeJS and MongoDB is a game based on the game Dofus madeby Ankama.<br>
In this repository you will find the part made with Unity but not yet the NodeJS and MongoDB parts.<br><br>
The goal is first to reproduce all the features I like in this game and then to implement my own ideas.<br>
The second goal is to test my IAs. For exemple I'm actually try to implement a neuronal network in the ennemies to make the game harder the more players there are. <br><br>
The game can't be tested yet because I didn't push the NodeJS and MongoDB parts on my server at the moment, you should be able to try it in the near future.
